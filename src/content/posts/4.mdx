# The new tech workforce on the AI world

AI is going to change the world in many ways, and one of the most significant changes will be how new human capital is selected for tech jobs. With the mainstream use of AI, the technical abilities of the interviewers will become less important, and the focus will shift to the human factor.

In the past, the technical skills and knowledge of the interviewers were crucial for evaluating the suitability of a candidate for a tech job. The interviewers would ask technical questions and test the candidates on their knowledge of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and other technical topics.

However, with the rise of AI, the technical skills of the interviewers are becoming less relevant. AI algorithms can now evaluate the technical abilities of the candidates much more accurately and objectively than human interviewers. AI algorithms can analyze the code that the candidates write, the projects they have worked on, and the technical challenges they have faced, and they can provide detailed feedback and recommendations on the candidate's technical abilities.

As a result, the human factor is becoming more important in the selection of new human capital for tech jobs. The interviewers will need to focus on evaluating the human qualities of the candidates, such as their ability to learn and adapt, their willingness to work hard, their ability to communicate effectively, and their overall personality and character.

The interviewers will need to ask questions that are designed to assess the human qualities of the candidates, and they will need to listen carefully to the answers and evaluate the candidates based on their responses.
