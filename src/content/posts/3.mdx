# Should i be worried about AI?

It is true that website development tools have become more user-friendly and automated in recent years, making it easier for individuals and businesses to create their own websites without needing extensive technical knowledge. However, this does not necessarily mean that the skill of website development will become irrelevant in the next few years, or at least this is what i think. But maybe I am tricking myself?

While it is true that some aspects of website development, such as choosing a color palette and organizing content, can be automated, there will still be a need for individuals with the knowledge and expertise to create custom features, design complex interfaces, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. For example: Do proper unit and E2E testing. Additionally, as technology continues to evolve and new trends and best practices emerge, website developers will need to stay up-to-date on these changes in order to create the best possible user experiences for their clients, and machines... are not very good at understanding clients, even sometimes, we as humans cannot understand each other.

Furthermore, while cloud computing platforms have made it easier to deploy web services and APIs, there is still a need for individuals with the knowledge and skills to use these tools effectively.

Website developers who are familiar with cloud computing platforms and the latest web technologies will be well-positioned to take advantage of these tools and create scalable, high-performance websites and web applications.
In conclusion, while website development tools have become more user-friendly and automated, the skill of website development will remain relevant in the coming years. Individuals with knowledge and expertise in website development will continue to be in demand, as businesses and organizations seek out their services to create custom, high-performance websites and web applications.
