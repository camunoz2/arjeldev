# Quality or quantity?

### More and more, we need moore.

I have three projects in the works: one focused on the Front-End with Vite and TypeScript and two Full-Stack applications with NextJS on the client side and SQL and Redis on the backend. I had plenty of doubts about how to implement TDD, how to abstract the logic of the state, whether to use Redux, and so on. Until I came across a Twitter post by someone which said: "It's better done than perfect" and "Don't waste time fixing problems that you don't have". These words of wisdom helped me move forward, but I will continue to refine my work and make sure it's perfect

```js
console.log("Cheers! ðŸ˜Š");
